Plan of action:
x	Update symmetric 60 to pull makefile from new repo
x	create our own dockerfile
x	write docker wrapper that generates a PDF schematic for fab output
x	update makefile to use docker wrapper that generates schematic for fab output
x	write docker wrapper that generates our BOM for fab output	
x	update makefile to use docker wrapper that generates BOM for fab output
x	update makefile to use

x	update dockerfile to push iBOM into docker
x	write docker wrapper that generates iBOM for fab output
x	update makefile to use
	
x	update dockerfile to push kiplot into docker
x	write docker wrapper to do kiplotting for fab output
x	update makefile to use
	
	document git practices (smudging and modding to reduce churn)

	document how to diff two schematic revs from commandline as an image

	write helper to diff schematic revs as an image

	document how to diff two layout revs from commandline as an image
	
	write helper to diff two layout revs as an image

	Automate ERC?

	Figure out how to automate KiCAD STEP exports
	write docker wrapper to do step export
	update makefile to do step export


	KiCost?

	figure out how to run ERC and get report 
	write docker wrapper to do erc
	update makefile to do erc


	figure out how to run DRC and get report 
	write docker wrapper to do drc
	update makefile to do drc
		


	update docker config to split out "path to share to docker" and "path to schematic"

Issues	
	management of kicad libraries outside the project directory


Output breaks when there's no tag in the history:

STP?
Package for seeed
Package for oshpark?
